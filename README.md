# Tensorflow Micropython Examples - Renewed, maybe

This is a fork of https://github.com/mocleiri/tensorflow-micropython-examples
For most relevant information, see there. I only forked it because the binaries for the firmware to upload to your ESP32 
was showing as "expired" on the original project page. As of 2024 Sept 26th, you can find the ESP32 bin file here:
